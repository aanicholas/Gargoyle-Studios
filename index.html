            <h2>Instructional design, 3D modeling, Game development</h2>

            <p>
              I’m a multidisciplinary digital creator with a background in 3D modeling, visualization,
              and technical design, and a growing focus on game development and interactive storytelling.
              My work blends engineering-driven thinking with cinematic, science-fiction–inspired worlds —
              from architectural visualization and product design to real-time environments and interactive
              prototypes.
              <br><br>
              I’m deeply fascinated by advanced propulsion systems, especially the Project ROVER nuclear
              thermal rocket program, as well as emerging technologies like 3D printing, real-time rendering,
              and procedural world building. These interests strongly influence both my visual style and the
              kinds of projects I pursue.
              <br><br>
              Gargoyle Studios began as a personal creative lab — a place to experiment, learn, and push the
              limits of what a solo creator can build. Today it represents the foundation of a future
              independent game studio focused on atmospheric science fiction, simulation-inspired mechanics,
              and player-driven storytelling.
              <br><br>
              I’m always learning, building and exploring new tools. Every project here is part of a larger
              journey toward gaining as much knowledge as I can and learning from pain points along the way.

        <h2>Instructional design</h2>

        <p>
          I approach instructional design with a continuous-improvement mindset. I like to learn new methods and test different approaches to achieve the strongest outcome for the learner and the business. In practice, that means I design from the learner’s point of view—checking whether information is presented clearly, whether key concepts are reinforced without unnecessary repetition, and whether activities and assessments align to the intended outcomes.
          <br><br>
          In most organizations, subject matter experts and stakeholders have final approval. I respect that reality while still advocating for the best end product. Over time, I’ve developed a strong ability to navigate sensitive or high-stakes conversations—asking the right questions, surfacing risks early, and proposing practical alternatives that protect quality without slowing delivery.
          <br><br>
          My first teaching experience in 3D/animation shaped how I think about learning design. It was challenging, and it forced me to pay close attention to learner needs: Who is this for? What assumptions am I making? Do the steps truly work as written? Are quiz questions clear and fair? Are we teaching the skills learners actually want and need?
          <br><br>
          A moment that stayed with me: a student asked, “Why are all the tutorials about mechanical objects? What about organic or softer objects?” The honest answer was that I personally gravitated toward mechanical modeling. The next week, I created two tutorial tracks—one on modeling the Voyager probe and one on modeling a rose—and I continued offering that balance for the remainder of the semester.
          <br><br>
          I also built feedback loops into the course. At the end of each semester, I asked students for three things that worked well and three that did not. In class, we reviewed student work with the same structure—three strengths and three improvements. This taught students how to give and receive feedback constructively, a skill that is valuable in any professional environment and one I still build into my learning projects today.

        <h2 class="h2-section">3D modeling</h2>
        <p>
          When I first began learning 3D modeling, Red Rocks Community College was the only local program offering animation—and it was entirely Mac-based. I was a PC user at the time, but I leaned into the learning curve and adapted quickly.
          <br><br>
          A pivotal moment came when NewTek released LightWave 3D for Mac. I was eager to learn it and asked repeatedly whether the department would offer a course. I was told the program would run in the fall—and then, unexpectedly, I was asked to teach it.
          <br><br>
          With a single summer to prepare, I taught myself LightWave from manuals and documentation (this was before YouTube and modern tutorial ecosystems). That first semester taught me a lasting lesson: instructional materials are only as good as their validation. Many published tutorials didn’t actually work as written, so I rebuilt lessons through hands-on testing, simplified steps, and created clearer examples. The result was a course that students continued into at the advanced level, and one that strengthened my approach to instructional design: learn fast, prototype early, test everything, and iterate based on what learners actually experience.
          <br><br>
          That experience shaped how I design learning today—especially in fast-changing tool environments—where clear structure, validated practice, and realistic expectations matter as much as the content itself.

        <h2 class="h2-section">Game development</h2>
        <p>When I was teaching 3D, I was invited to speak to a game development class about preparing and importing assets into Unreal Engine 2. That moment was genuinely mind-expanding. Up to that point, I saw animation as something you did for film or television. Unreal introduced a different idea: real-time worlds where you could build scenes, script interactions, and effectively “direct” a story inside the engine.
            <br><br>
            I started experimenting immediately—basic scripting, elevator logic, breakable glass, and simple interactive sequences—trying to understand how real-time systems worked. Even though the visual fidelity of the era was limited, the creative potential was obvious.
            <br><br>
            That path changed when the college discontinued the LightWave program and shifted to Maya, and I lost access to the tools and lab environment that made that work possible. My career moved through several roles—video editing, lab support in mineral recovery pilot plants, architectural drafting—and ultimately into instructional design. But the thread never disappeared. I kept thinking about how interactive 3D environments could be used for training and performance support, and I periodically explored what real-time simulation could enable, especially for safety and operational learning.
            <br><br>
            More recently, I’ve been closing the gap between creative intent and technical execution by building an Unreal Engine 5 plugin that embeds a ChatGPT-based assistant directly into the editor. The goal is to reduce friction for non-programmers by generating usable C++ scaffolding from plain-language requests—e.g., “Create a platform of a specific size and color that hovers and oscillates ten meters”—and producing a proper Actor as a starting point. The code still requires review and occasional adjustment, but it materially accelerates iteration and helps convert ideas into working prototypes.
            <br><br>
            I’m intentionally using AI as a capability multiplier: not to avoid understanding, but to move faster, learn by doing, and make advanced workflows more accessible. Blueprints remain excellent for many problems, but for performance-critical or systems-heavy features, C++ can be the better long-term foundation—especially when you want solutions that scale cleanly.
